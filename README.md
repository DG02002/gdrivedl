<summary>Create Your Own Account OAuth 2.0 Client IDs to access Google Drive API</summary>

### Enable Google Drive API

Before using Google APIs, you need to turn them on in a Google Cloud project. You can turn on one or more APIs in a single Google Cloud project.

In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=drive.googleapis.com), enable the Google Drive API. 

#### Getting credentials for a desktop application

To authenticate as an end user and access user data in your app, you need to create one or more OAuth 2.0 Client IDs. A client ID is used to identify a single app to Google's OAuth servers. If your app runs on multiple platforms, you must create a separate client ID for each platform.

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to Menu â‰¡ > APIs & Services > [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. Click Create Credentials > OAuth client ID.
3. Click Application type > Desktop app.
4. In the Name field, type a name for the credential. This name is only shown in the Google Cloud console.
5. Click Create. The OAuth client created screen appears, showing your new Client ID and Client secret.
6. Click OK. and Use the download button to download your credentials.
